      <p>I don't think about dragons as much as I used to.  Dragons, of course, only exist in imaginations.  So thinking about dragons is a way of saying that you're imagining.</p>
      <p>It could also be a metaphor for imagining in general.  It would be cool if "thinking about dragons" was another way of saying "I'm dreaming of possibilities."</p>
      <p>But I  suspect that if the phrase "thinking about dragons" DID come to mean "I'm dreaming of possibilies," it wouldn't take long for its use to skew critical.  Instead of people bragging about "thinking about dragons," unimaginative and insecure people would start using it as a metophor for being impractical or frivolous: "There you go again.  Always thinking about dragons."</p>
      <p>I've probably done that to myself: let "thinking about dragons" evolve from a boast to a confession.  I used to be proud to think about dragons.  Now, I'm a little embarrassed about it.  How much time have I wasted thinking about dragons?  It makes me sad to think about.</p>
      <p>Dragons are devilish beasts.  They'll trick you into thinking about them, but then what?  They don't help you pay the bills or become a better husband or father or friend.  They don't stand alongside you as you fight for the oppressed, for justice, for love.  They might even trick you into believing that thinking about dragons is, in itself, doing those things.  Like I said: devilish beasts.</p>
      <p>Once, for a class, I decided to write a poem about dragons.  I wasn't sure how it was going to go.  I just started writing.  People liked it.  I started to read it at poetry slams, and even won a couple.</p>
      <p>Over the years, I've revisited what I wrote.  I've edited it, cleaned it up, added to it, trimmed from it, and read it hundreds of times trying to perfect the rhythm.</p>
      <p>I might not ever finish it.  Maybe that's part of what dragons do.  They draw you back.  They waste your time, but make you think you're doing something important.</p>
      <p>Since I've never met a dragon, I can only speculate.</p>
      <p>I want to learn something from the dragon in my little poem.  But if he knows that that's what I want, he'll try to get me to learn the wrong message.  I'm not sure if I'm clever enough not to fall for his trick.</p>
      <p>Maybe you are.  You, whoever you are.  Maybe you can read this, and know the lesson, embrace it, and be changed by it.  Think about dragons when you want, in the way you want, and for the reasons you want.</p>
      <p>Or maybe there's no lesson at all, which itself would be a lesson.</p>
      <p>Read...  then defy the very dragon whose influence led you to read in the first place.  Think about dragons, then--at just the right moment--adamently refuse to think about dragons.</p>

      <p><h2>The Dragon and the Boy</h2></p>
      <p>The boy had long dreamed that the day would arrive<br>
      That he'd battle the dragon and march home alive<br>
      To the cheers of the villagers finally released<br>
      From the ongoing threat of the devilish beast.</p>
      <p>  One might even think that the boy was obsessed<br>
      From the hours he spent contemplating his quest.<br>
      So the boy kept his dream hidden safely away--<br>
      No, he told not a soul, out of fear that he may</p>
         
         <p>  Be labeled a dreamer, naïve, or a fool<br>
         By the gossipy townsfolk, some caring, some cruel.<br>
         For years the boy hid in his heart his desire<br>
         'Til one fateful night, 'round the comforting fire</p>
         
         <p>  The boy and his friends told and listened to stories.<br>
         They laughed and they sang with no thought to life's worries.<br>
         They ate and they drank, then they started to tire<br>
         As embers remained where there once blazed a fire.</p>
         
         <p>   Then the boy felt a surge in his chest like a wave<br>
         And it made him feel forceful and honest and brave<br>
         And without even thinking he jumped to his feet<br>
         And announced, "There's a task I am called to complete!"</p>
         
         <p>   Then he took a step back and explained what he meant<br>
         To his friends, though he knew they would try to prevent<br>
         Him from risking his life for a childish dream<br>
         But his friends, they responded in ways unforeseen.</p>
         
         <p>   They listened and nodded and spoke not a word<br>
         'Til one of them stood up and firmly assured<br>
         "When a dream is infused with a passion so strong<br>
         It will burn like a fire but it won't burn for long.</p>
         <p>   You're clearly prepared for this quest hereupon<br>
         I implore you to leave at the first light of dawn!"<br>
         The rest of his friends stood and shouted, "Hear, hear!"<br>
         "That you are thus called is abundantly clear."</p>
         
         <p>   Encouraged and humbled the boy went to rest<br>
         Before he embarked on his glorious quest.<br>
         And a few hours later the town's rooster crowed<br>
         And the boy met his friends near the mill on the road</p>
         
         <p>   That would lead to the woods and a field that was known<br>
         To harbor the cave that the dragon called home.<br>
         His friends gave him rations and sharpened his sword<br>
         Then he bowed to each one, giving thanks without words.</p>
         
         <p>   Then he turned down the road and he marched as one does<br>
         When one knows he will never be who he once was.<br>
         A man, he'd soon be, and a boy nevermore<br>
         And the townsfolk would wonder how had they ignored</p>
         
         <p>   For so long, in their midst, the one who would slaughter<br>
         The dragon who threatened their sons and their daughters.<br>
         They would cheer at the sight of the head of the beast<br>
         And they'd lift the boy high and prepare him a feast</p>
         
         <p>   And if asked to reflect on the battle he'd fought<br>
         He would say, "I am grateful, but feel that we ought<br>
         To remember the men who, before me, have died.<br>
         So I share all the glory, and share it with pride."</p>
         
         <p>   So engrossed was the boy by these scenes in his mind<br>
         That he jumped with a start when he looked up to find<br>
         That the sun was now perched straight above in the sky<br>
         And the cool morning hours had passed him right by.</p>
         <p>   The visions that moments before had brought peace<br>
         Were now instantly melted away by the heat<br>
         And replaced with awareness of things that were real<br>
         Like the stitch in his side or the sweat he could feel</p>
         
         <p>   Dripping into his eyes mixing in with his tears;<br>
         Or the weight on his back of his rations and gear;<br>
         Or his foul, sticky clothes; or his mouth, dry and cracked.<br>
         Still he mumbled his mantra: "I will not turn back."</p>
         
         <p>   Then he watched as the trail, into trees, disappeared<br>
         And he felt himself shiver with something like fear.<br>
         But he knew that the path to the beast this way laid<br>
         And the trees, though imposing, provided him shade.</p>
         
         <p>   Of course, every day must be followed by night<br>
         And soon the sun set, with its warmth and its light<br>
         And the boy couldn't see where his feet should be placed<br>
         Nor the branches that scraped at his hands and his face.</p>
         
         <p>   And he squeezed through the trees as the forest grew thicker.<br>
         His legs burned in pain still he tried to walk quicker.<br>
         His vision was blurred, and his thoughts became scattered<br>
         And his muscles screamed out as if they had been battered.</p>
         
         <p>   The breeze burned his eyes and his body grew chilled<br>
         But all he could think was "the beast must be killed."<br>
         For hours he trudged, fully sure he would die<br>
         'Til his eyes, through the trees, caught a glimpse of the sky.</p>
         
         <p>   Off in the distance the sky was transforming<br>
         Light replaced dark—he had made it 'til morning!<br>
         Now his tears were of joy and strength was restored<br>
         And he thought of the dragon, first sleeping, then gored.</p>
         <p>   Or would he be waiting, prepared for a fight?<br>
         Would he charge on the ground?  Would he soar into flight?<br>
         The boy didn't know, and he didn't much care<br>
         For he knew either way he'd be fully prepared.</p>
         
         <p>   So weaved through the woods as he whistled a song<br>
         And his heart in his chest pounded hopeful and strong.<br>
         Then he saw, up ahead, that the trees finally cleared<br>
         And he entered the meadow beyond which appeared</p>
         
         <p>   A crack in the ground, strangely not overgrown.<br>
         This was the cave that the dragon called home.<br>
         Once more the boy pictured the beast lying dead.<br>
         Then, hearing the chants of his name in his head—</p>
         
         <p>   Sandwiched by calls of "long live" and "the brave"—<br>
         The boy raced ahead to the mouth of the cave.<br>
         He clung to his sword, then refocused, and then,<br>
         Welling with passion he yelled in the den:</p>
         
         <p>   "Dragon!  You tyrant!  You show yourself now!"<br>
         "I've come to fulfill my unbreakable vow!"<br>
         The beast stumbled out, looking squinty and tired<br>
         And glared at the boy, so brave and inspired.</p>
         
         <p>   "What do you want?"  It impatiently sighed.<br>
         "To cut out your heart!"  Was the boy's quick reply.<br>
         "Oh.  One of those."  And the beast rolled his eyes.<br>
         "You seem pretty brave, but you're not very wise.</p>
         
         <p>   I see that you're not yet a man, but a boy,<br>
         So run along, now, and go play with your toys."<br>
         The boy was appalled, and he held his head high.<br>
         "You cowardly dragon!  Prepare ye to die!"</p>
         
         <p>   But the beast didn't flinch, fight, or flee, but instead<br>
         He snorted a laugh and he twisted his head<br>
         Back toward the cave, then he bellowed a call<br>
         And two dragons strolled out, making three overall.</p>
         
         <p>   The boy swallowed hard as the dragons all stared.<br>
         Then the first dragon whispered, "Attack me," it dared.<br>
         The eyes of the boy darted left and then right<br>
         And he realized his chances of winning this fight</p>
         
         <p>   Were not very high, so he shifted, then said<br>
         "Mr. Dragon, why fight, when I think that instead<br>
         If we sat down and talked we could end up as friends."<br>
         But the boy knew that dragons do not make amends.</p>
         
         <p>   So the boy dropped his sword and then desperately turned<br>
         But the first dragon roared for the boy to be burned.<br>
         He breathed at the boy and engulfed him in flames<br>
         Then he cackled and danced as his friends did the same.</p>
         
         <p>   The boy flailed, and patted his clothes and his hair<br>
         And heaved as his lungs breathed in fire, not air.<br>
         As the pain overwhelmed, the boy fell to the ground—<br>
         Once screaming, now still, now not making a sound.</p>
         
         <p>   His bones burned to ash and the grass roasted black<br>
         While the dragons reflected upon this attack.<br>
         The first dragon smiled, then said to the pair,<br>
         "That poor, foolish boy—why, he thought I'd fight fair."</p>
